# Cryptosystem

This library provides a generic cryptography system for Rust crates using abstraction traits like `SymmetricCryptosystem`, which captures a series of related primitives that enable encryption and decryption using the same key. This API is high-level, but aims to remain generic for use with any algorithm.
